# Pokedex

This app is a Pokédex inspired by the original Pokémon anime series.
It utilizes the [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) to fetch data on all Pokemon.

Currently, only Kanto region Pokémon are available, but future updates may include additional regions.

The user interface (UI) is inspired by [this](https://www.figma.com/design/ljSEdt2o1jlhNAICqiLVo4/Pok%C3%A9dex-(Community)?node-id=314-3&node-type=canvas&t=E6n3ZAr8JPYqRo95-0) beautiful Pókedex design in Figma.

The Pokédex app is a cross-platform application designed to run on both mobile devices (***Android & iOS***) and web browsers.

The project is structured into two main parts:
- mobile-app folder: Houses the core app logic and platform-specific implementations for mobile (Android and iOS) and web.
- ui_kit folder: Houses reusable UI components and utilities shared across both mobile and web versions, promoting code consistency and maintainability.
